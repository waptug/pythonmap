# pythonmap

This code is a collection of tools to create a leaflet map powered by a php api
which reads data from a json file to create a map with mappoints on each state 
and territory capital which are links to the state web site

To use the python code to generate the javascript you will need to install the required pip librarys.
Other wise you can just use map4.html and this will work. 

Make sure all the files are in the same folder on your server for the api to work.
